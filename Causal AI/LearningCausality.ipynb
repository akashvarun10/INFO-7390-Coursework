Traditional machine learning methods focus on prediction tasks, such as classification and regression, without explicitly considering causal relationships between variables. In contrast, **causal ML** aims to go beyond prediction by identifying and estimating the **causal effects** of **interventions or treatments on outcomes of interest**.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Treatment**: The variable or intervention being studied for its causal effect on an outcome. It can be binary (e.g., receiving a drug or not) or continuous (e.g., dosage level).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outcome**: The variable of interest whose response is being studied to determine the causal effect of the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomized Controlled Trial**: RCT stands for Randomized Controlled Trial. It is a type of experimental study design commonly used in medical and scientific research to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions or treatments. In an RCT, participants are randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which receives the intervention being studied, or a control group, which does not receive the intervention (typically receiving a placebo or standard treatment). Randomization helps to ensure that the groups are comparable at baseline, reducing the risk of confounding variables influencing the results. RCTs are considered the gold standard for assessing causal relationships between treatments and outcomes because they provide strong evidence of causality when properly conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confounding**: The presence of unobserved variables that affect both the treatment assignment and the outcome, leading to biased estimates of causal effects if not properly controlled for.\n",

    "**Selection Bias**: Selection bias occurs when the process of selecting participants for a study systematically excludes certain groups or individuals, resulting in a sample that is not representative of the target population. This bias can distort the results of a study, leading to erroneous conclusions about causal relationships between variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Counterfactuals**: Counterfactuals are hypothetical scenarios representing what would have happened under different conditions or interventions. They are essential for estimating causal effects by comparing observed outcomes to hypothetical outcomes. In causal inference, counterfactuals allow researchers to assess the impact of treatments or interventions on outcomes of interest. Estimating counterfactuals involves imagining what the outcome would have been if individuals had received different treatments, enabling the evaluation of causal relationships in observational studies. Counterfactual analysis helps researchers make informed decisions and draw valid causal conclusions from observed data.\n",
