    "### What is Causal ML? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Causal machine learning** (Causal ML) is a field that combines elements of **causal inference and machine learning** to estimate **causal effects** from observational data. Traditional machine learning methods focus on prediction tasks, such as classification and regression, without explicitly considering causal relationships between variables. In contrast, **causal ML** aims to go beyond prediction by identifying and estimating the **causal effects** of **interventions or treatments on outcomes of interest**."

    "Let's now learn about **Causal Inference**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Causal inference** is the process of drawing conclusions about **cause-and-effect relationships** between variables based on observed data. It involves determining whether changes in one variable directly lead to changes in another variable, beyond mere correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key aspects of causal inference include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identification of Causal Effects**: Determining which variables are causes and which are effects, and estimating the magnitude and direction of the causal relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Control of Confounding**: Addressing confounding variables that may distort the observed association between the variables of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Counterfactual Reasoning**: Considering what would have happened under different conditions or interventions to estimate causal effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Causal Mechanisms**: Understanding the underlying mechanisms through which causal effects occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Causal inference** methods include **randomized controlled trials** (RCTs) in experimental settings, as well as observational studies, structural equation modeling, and causal graphical models in observational settings. The goal of causal inference is to provide **reliable and actionable insights into the effects of interventions or policies on outcomes of interest, aiding decision-making** in various fields such as healthcare, economics, and social sciences."
